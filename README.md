# Overview

Java console application where the user gets to manage a collection of different salon-related products (shampoo, disenfectants, brushes, etc.) through a text-based menu.

It allows the user to view, add, remove, and search for products.

Concepts used:
- Object oriented programming (OOP)
- Arrays (1D and 2D)
- Dynamic array resizing
- Insertion & bubble sort
- Scanner user input handling and formatted output using DecimalFOrmat

Main client code is ProductClient.java, which:
- Creates and manages a 2D array of Product objects
- Handles user input and interaction

Product is the base class, which:
- ShampooAndConditioner
- Disinfectant
- Brush
- HairstylingProduct
- OtherUtensil

are the subclasses.
